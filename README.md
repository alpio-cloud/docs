# ðŸ˜€ What is Alpio?

## General description

Alpio is a **cloud service** allowing you to **generate live backends on the fly** with minimal configuration. Backends are hosted on our servers, so you don't have to worry about hosting or deployments.

## How does it work?

You create a project, and configure it through a CLI (a GUI will be added later). During the configuration, you define your **data models** (the entities that describe your business use cases), and your **API endpoints** (what parameters they accept, what data they return). When you're done, you can simply deploy your project, which only **takes a few minutes.** &#x20;

## What are the main features?

Each project created on Alpio includes:

* A managed **database**
* A live **REST API**
* **Authentication** for your API

## Who is it for?

Alpio is designed for anyone who wants to quickly deploy a live backend with minimal configuration required. Here a few examples:

* A designer, or frontend developer wanting to add backend to their mobile or web app
* A developer who needs a working backend in minutes to prototype their idea
* A developer or team of developers needing to spun small to mid-size backends for independent parts of their application

Although having web development experience will help you understand the different concepts & terminology, it is not required for a basic use of Alpio.
