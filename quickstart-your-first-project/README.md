# ðŸš© Quickstart: your first project

In this tutorial, you will learn to create a project on Alpio, configure it, and deploy it to the cloud. We will simply extend the starter template which is used when you create a new project.

In this project, we will expose an API representing planets and galaxies, with CRUD (create, read, update, delete) endpoints.

Before we start, make sure you have [installed Alpio and created an account](../setup-and-usage.md).
