# ✏️ Editing your project

If you want to add more data models, endpoints, or change the existing configuration of your project, use the following command to edit it:

```
alpio projects edit
```

You will be able to edit its configuration, through the same process you used in the [Configuring your project](configuring-your-project.md) step.

Once you are done, you can choose to immediately deploy your modifications, or deploy later using the following command:

```
alpio projects deploy
```
